      "specific-function :                                          Gag-Pol polyprotein: Mediates, with Gag polyrotein, the essential events in virion assembly, including binding the plasma membrane, making the protein-protein interactions necessary to create spherical particles, recruiting the viral Env proteins, and packaging the genomic RNA via direct interactions with the RNA packaging sequence (Psi). Gag-Pol polyprotein may regulate its own translation, by the binding genomic RNA in the 5'-UTR. At low concentration, the polyprotein would promote translation, whereas at high concentration, the polyprotein would encapsidate genomic RNA and then shutt off translation.Matrix protein p17: Targets the polyprotein to the plasma membrane via a multipartite membrane-binding signal, that includes its myristoylated N-terminus (By similarity). Matrix protein is part of the pre-integration complex. Implicated in the release from host cell mediated by Vpu. Binds to RNA (By similarity).Capsid protein p24: Forms the conical core that encapsulates the genomic RNA-nucleocapsid complex in the virion (PubMed:8648689). Most core are conical, with only 7% tubular. The core is constituted by capsid protein hexamer subunits. The core is disassembled soon after virion entry (PubMed:12660176). Host restriction factors such as monkey TRIM5-alpha or TRIMCyp bind retroviral capsids and cause premature capsid disassembly, leading to blocks in reverse transcription. Capsid restriction by TRIM5 is one of the factors which restricts HIV-1 to the human species (PubMed:23785198). Host PIN1 apparently facilitates the virion uncoating (By similarity). On the other hand, interactions with PDZD8 or CYPA stabilize the capsid (PubMed:24554657).Nucleocapsid protein p7: Encapsulates and protects viral dimeric unspliced genomic RNA (gRNA). Binds these RNAs through its zinc fingers. Acts as a nucleic acid chaperone which is involved in rearangement of nucleic acid secondary structure during gRNA retrotranscription. Also facilitates template switch leading to recombination. As part of the polyprotein, participates to gRNA dimerization, packaging, tRNA incorporation and virion assembly.Protease: Aspartyl protease that mediates proteolytic cleavages of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins during or shortly after the release of the virion from the plasma membrane (PubMed:9573231) (PubMed:11932404). Cleavages take place as an ordered, step-wise cascade to yield mature proteins (PubMed:9573231) (PubMed:11932404). This process is called maturation (PubMed:9573231) (PubMed:11932404). Displays maximal activity during the budding process just prior to particle release from the cell (PubMed:9573231) (PubMed:11932404). Also cleaves Nef and Vif, probably concomitantly with viral structural proteins on maturation of virus particles (PubMed:7835426). Hydrolyzes host EIF4GI and PABP1 in order to shut off the capped cellular mRNA translation. The resulting inhibition of cellular protein synthesis serves to ensure maximal viral gene expression and to evade host immune response (PubMed:12660176) (PubMed:19914170).Reverse transcriptase/ribonuclease H: Multifunctional enzyme that converts the viral RNA genome into dsDNA in the cytoplasm, shortly after virus entry into the cell. This enzyme displays a DNA polymerase activity that can copy either DNA or RNA templates, and a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity that cleaves the RNA strand of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes in a partially processive 3' to 5' endonucleasic mode. Conversion of viral genomic RNA into dsDNA requires many steps. A tRNA(3)-Lys binds to the primer-binding site (PBS) situated at the 5'-end of the viral RNA. RT uses the 3' end of the tRNA primer to perform a short round of RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis. The reading proceeds through the U5 region and ends after the repeated (R) region which is present at both ends of viral RNA. The portion of the RNA-DNA heteroduplex is digested by the RNase H, resulting in a ssDNA product attached to the tRNA primer. This ssDNA/tRNA hybridizes with the identical R region situated at the 3' end of viral RNA. This template exchange, known as minus-strand DNA strong stop transfer, can be either intra- or intermolecular. RT uses the 3' end of this newly synthesized short ssDNA to perform the RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis of the whole template. RNase H digests the RNA template except for two polypurine tracts (PPTs) situated at the 5'-end and near the center of the genome. It is not clear if both polymerase and RNase H activities are simultaneous. RNase H probably can proceed both in a polymerase-dependent (RNA cut into small fragments by the same RT performing DNA synthesis) and a polymerase-independent mode (cleavage of remaining RNA fragments by free RTs). Secondly, RT performs DNA-directed plus-strand DNA synthesis using the PPTs that have not been removed by RNase H as primers. PPTs and tRNA primers are then removed by RNase H. The 3' and 5' ssDNA PBS regions hybridize to form a circular dsDNA intermediate. Strand displacement synthesis by RT to the PBS and PPT ends produces a blunt ended, linear dsDNA copy of the viral genome that includes long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends.Integrase: Catalyzes viral DNA integration into the host chromosome, by performing a series of DNA cutting and joining reactions. This enzyme activity takes place after virion entry into a cell and reverse transcription of the RNA genome in dsDNA. The first step in the integration process is 3' processing. This step requires a complex comprising the viral genome, matrix protein, Vpr and integrase. This complex is called the pre-integration complex (PIC). The integrase protein removes 2 nucleotides from each 3' end of the viral DNA, leaving recessed CA OH's at the 3' ends. In the second step, the PIC enters cell nucleus. This process is mediated through integrase and Vpr proteins, and allows the virus to infect a non dividing cell. This ability to enter the nucleus is specific of lentiviruses, other retroviruses cannot and rely on cell division to access cell chromosomes. In the third step, termed strand transfer, the integrase protein joins the previously processed 3' ends to the 5' ends of strands of target cellular DNA at the site of integration. The 5'-ends are produced by integrase-catalyzed staggered cuts, 5 bp apart. A Y-shaped, gapped, recombination intermediate results, with the 5'-ends of the viral DNA strands and the 3' ends of target DNA strands remaining unjoined, flanking a gap of 5 bp. The last step is viral DNA integration into host chromosome. This involves host DNA repair synthesis in which the 5 bp gaps between the unjoined strands are filled in and then ligated. Since this process occurs at both cuts flanking the HIV genome, a 5 bp duplication of host DNA is produced at the ends of HIV-1 integration. Alternatively, Integrase may catalyze the excision of viral DNA just after strand transfer, this is termed disintegration.\n",

Clinical trials demonstrate that overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine did not result in death. A lethal outcome was reported in a clinical trial after an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine.  In the case of an acute overdose, ensure to maintain an airway and provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric lavage following intubation (if necessary) along with activated charcoal and a laxative may be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiac monitoring should also take place.[L8546]\\r\\n\\r\\n**A note on QT-interval prolongation in an overdose**\\r\\n\\r\\nPostmarketing reports reveal increases in the cardiac QT interval in cases of quetiapine overdose, concomitant illness, and in those taking drugs that increase QT interval or affect electrolyte levels.[L8546]  Note that disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine may exert additive QT-prolonging effects when administered in patients who have overdosed with quetiapine, and should be avoided.[A185834,A185837,L8546]',\n",

Target organs for neoplastic changes were the kidneys (renal tubule and renal pelvis), urinary bladder, urethra, preputial and clitoral gland, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, and non-glandular stomach. Neoplastic lesions were not seen at 30 mg/kg/day for the kidneys, urinary bladder, urethra, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, and non-glandular stomach, and 15 mg/kg/day for the preputial and clitoral gland. The papilloma/carcinoma of the preputial/clitoral gland was noted at 30 and 60 mg/kg/day, representing approximately 0.5 to 4 or 0.3 to 2.4 times the human daily exposure (based on AUC) at 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day, respectively, and 0.4 to 3.0 times the daily exposure in children (based on AUC) at 340 mg/m2. The renal tubule adenoma/carcinoma, renal pelvis transitional cell neoplasms, the urinary bladder and urethra transitional cell papillomas, the small intestine adenocarcinomas, the parathyroid glands adenomas, the benign and malignant medullary tumors of the adrenal glands and the non-glandular stomach papillomas/carcinomas were noted at 60 mg/kg/day. The relevance of these findings in the rat carcinogenicity study for humans is not known. Positive genotoxic effects were obtained for imatinib in an in vitro mammalian cell assay (Chinese hamster ovary) for clastogenicity (chromosome aberrations) in the presence of metabolic activation. Two intermediates of the manufacturing process, which are also present in the final product, are positive for mutagenesis in the Ames assay. One of these intermediates was also positive in the mouse lymphoma assay. Imatinib was not genotoxic when tested in an in vitro bacterial cell assay (Ames test), an in vitro mammalian cell assay (mouse lymphoma) and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay.[L42080]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a study of fertility, male rats were dosed for 70 days prior to mating and female rats were dosed 14 days prior to mating and through to gestational Day 6. Testicular and epididymal weights and percent motile sperm were decreased at 60 mg/kg, approximately three-fourths the maximum clinical dose of 800 mg/day based on BSA. This was not seen at doses less than or equal to 20 mg/kg (one-fourth of the maximum human dose of 800 mg). The fertility of male and female rats was not affected.[L42080] \\r\\n\\r\\nFertility was not affected in the preclinical fertility and early embryonic development study although lower testes and epididymal weights, as well as a reduced number of motile sperm, were observed in the high-dose male rats. In the preclinical pre-and postnatal study in rats, fertility in the first generation offspring was also not affected by imatinib\\r\\nmesylate.[L42080]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to consider potential toxicities suggested by animal studies, specifically, liver, kidney, and cardiac toxicity and immunosuppression. Severe liver toxicity was observed in dogs treated for 2 weeks, with elevated liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct necrosis, and bile duct hyperplasia. Renal toxicity was observed in monkeys treated for 2 weeks, with focal mineralization and dilation of the renal tubules and tubular nephrosis. Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were observed in several of these animals. An increased rate of opportunistic infections was observed with chronic imatinib treatment in laboratory animal studies. In a 39-week monkey study, treatment with imatinib resulted in the worsening of normally suppressed malarial infections in these animals. Lymphopenia was observed in animals (as in humans). Additional long-term toxicities were identified in a 2-year rat study. Histopathological examination of the treated rats that died in the study revealed cardiomyopathy (both sexes), chronic progressive nephropathy (females), and preputial gland papilloma as principal causes of death or reasons for sacrifice. Non-neoplastic lesions seen in this 2-year study that were not identified in earlier preclinical studies were the cardiovascular system, pancreas, endocrine organs, and teeth. The most important changes included cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation, leading to signs of cardiac insufficiency in some animals.[L42080]',\n",

Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy.

Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects).

The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.[L47941]\\r\\n\\r\\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses ≥ 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.[L47941] \\r\\n\\r\\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients,\\r\\nwho may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction.[L47941]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\\r\\n• Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.[L47941]\\r\\n• Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes.

       "       \"Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY, during the third trimester of  pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to aripiprazole have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, or major depressive disorder, and with exposure to antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, during pregnancy.[L45859] \\r\\n\\r\\nIn animal reproduction studies, oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during organogenesis in rats and/or rabbits at doses 10 and 19 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area, produced fetal death, decreased fetal weight, undescended testicles, delayed skeletal ossification, skeletal abnormalities, and diaphragmatic hernia. Oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during the pre- and post-natal period in rats at doses 10 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area, produced prolonged gestation, stillbirths, decreased pup weight, and decreased pup survival.[L45859]  \\r\\n\\r\\nABILIFY has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of ABILIFY misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).[L45859]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn physical dependence studies in monkeys, withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed.[L45859] \\r\\n\\r\\nIn clinical trials and in postmarketing experience, adverse reactions of deliberate or accidental overdosage with oral ABILIFY have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with oral ABILIFY alone and in combination with other substances. No fatality was reported with ABILIFY alone. The largest known dose with a known outcome involved acute ingestion of 1,260 mg of oral ABILIFY (42 times the maximum recommended daily dose) by a patient who fully recovered. Deliberate or accidental overdosage was also reported in children (age 12 years and younger) involving oral ABILIFY ingestions up to 195 mg with no fatalities.[L45859]  \\r\\n\\r\\nCommon adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of all overdose cases) reported with oral ABILIFY overdosage (alone or in combination with other substances) include vomiting, somnolence, and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in one or more patients with ABILIFY overdoses (alone or with other substances) include acidosis, aggression, aspartate aminotransferase increased, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusional state, convulsion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, QRS complex prolonged, QT prolonged, pneumonia aspiration, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and tachycardia.[L45859] \\r\\n\\r\\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with ABILIFY. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and if QT interval prolongation is present, cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.[L45859]  \\r\\n_Charcoal_: In the event of an overdose of ABILIFY, an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole. Administration of 50 g of activated charcoal, one hour after a single 15 mg oral dose of ABILIFY, decreased the mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of aripiprazole by 50%.[L45859] \\r\\n_Hemodialysis_: Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with ABILIFY, hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.[L45859]  \\r\\n\\r\\nLifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice, F344 rats, and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day to ICR mice and 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats (0.2, 0.5, 2 and 5 times and 0.3, 1 and 3 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area, respectively). In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 3, 6, 13 and 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area. Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or male rats. In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day (0.5 to 5 times the MRHD). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD).[L45859] \\r\\n\\r\\nAn increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be mediated by prolonged dopamine D2-receptor antagonism and hyperprolactinemia. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13 week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4 week and 13 week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unclear.[L45859]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the in vitro bacterial reverse-mutation assay, the in vitro bacterial DNA repair assay, the in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3-DCPP) were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3-DCPP, increased numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice; however, the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.[L45859] \\r\\n\\r\\nFemale rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation Day 7 at doses of 2, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day, which are 0.6, 2, and 6 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased pre-implantation loss was seen at 2 and 6 times the MRHD, and decreased fetal weight was seen at 6 times the MRHD.[L45859] \\r\\n\\r\\nMale rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating at doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 6, 13, and 19 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area.

This risk is also conferred on other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. It is proposed that increased duration of the drug treatment is likely thus increased total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient leads to increased risk for developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible. As with other antipsychotic agents, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially fatal symptom complex, which is manifested as hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no known antidote for prochlorperazine thus overdose treatment should be supportive and symptomatic. Overdose of prochlorperazine may produce dystonic reactions that involve extrapyramidal mechanism. To reduce these symptoms, antiparkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine may be used. Symptoms of central nervous system depression, such as somnolence or coma, may also be observed. Amphetamine, destroamphetamine, or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be used to induce stimulatory effects. In contrast, agitation and restlessness may also be seen in case of overdose. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus. Hypotension can be responded with the standard measures for managing circulatory shock.[label] \\r\\n\\r\\n**Nonclinical Toxicology**\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a rat developmental or reproductive toxicity study, abnormalities in both the reproductive measures and neurobehavioral testing were observed following administration of 25 mg/kg of prochlorperazine.[L6649] \\r\\n\\r\\n**Use in specific populations**\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the use of antipsychotic agents during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with a risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, the use of prochlorperazine in pregnant patients is generally not recommended and it should be limited after careful consideration of the potential benefit of drug therapy justifying the potential risk to the fetus. Caution should be exercised when prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing mother. While lower doses of prochlorperazine is reported to be safe for elderly patients, caution is still advised, especially those with higher susceptibility to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions.[label]',\n",

In older age, nephrotoxicity from salicylates increases, and the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is increased, with higher rates of mortality [A32954]. It is also important to note that ASA toxicity may  occur even with close to normal serum concentrations. Prevention of chronic ASA includes the administration of smallest possible doses, avoidance of concurrent use of salicylate drugs, and therapeutic drug monitoring.

       "       'Oral LD50 (rat): 1242 mg/kg, Oral LD50 (mouse): 100 mg/kg, lntraperitoneal LD50 (mouse): 500 mg/kg [MSDS]\\r\\n\\r\\nFenofibric acid is contraindicated for: (a) patients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis, (b) patients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities, (c) patients with preexisting gallbladder disease, (d) patients with known hypersensitivity to fenofibric acid or Fenofibrate, and (e) nursing mothers [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between the use of fenofibric acid and risk of mortality and coronary heart disease morbidity has not been formally established [FDA Label]. However, a number of studies involving fenofibrate and agents that are chemically and pharmacologically similar to fenofibrate demonstrate inconclusive results. In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, a non-significant 11% (HR 1.11 [0.95, 1.29], p=0.18) and 19% (HR 1.19 [0.90, 1.57], p=0.22) increase in total and coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, with Fenofibrate as compared to placebo [FDA Label]. For the Coronary Drug Project, a large study of post myocardial infarction of patients treated for 5 years with clofibrate, there was a difference in the rate of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis requiring surgery between the clofibrate and placebo groups of 3.0% vs. 1.8%, respectively [FDA Label]. The World Health Organization (WHO) also conducted a study in which 5000 subjects without known coronary artery disease were treated with placebo or clofibrate for 5 years and followed for an additional year [FDA Label]. The results involved a statistically significant, higher age-adjusted all-cause mortality in the clofibrate group compared with the placebo group (5.70% vs. 3.96%, p<0.01) in which excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and pancreatitis [FDA Label]. With the Helsinki Heart Study, 4081 middle aged men without a history of coronary artery disease were given either placebo or gemfibrozil for 5 years, with a 3.5 year open extension afterward [FDA Label]. Although total mortality was numerically higher in the gemfibrozil arm, it was statistically significant (p=0.19, 95% confidence interval for relative risk = 0.91-1.64). Finally, a secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study observed middle aged men not included in the primary prevention study because they had known or suspected coronary heart disease [FDA Label]. When these subjects were administered gemfibrozil or placebo therapy for 5 years, cardiac deaths trended higher in the gemfibrozil group but was ultimately not statistically significant (HR 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.94-5.05) [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nFibrates facilitate the risk for myopathy and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis [FDA Label]. The risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal failure, or hypothyroidism [FDA Label]. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgia, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase levels [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nFenofibrate administered across a range of doses with the higher dose equivalent to 105 mg fenofibric acid has been associated with increases in serum transaminases like AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) [FDA Label]. In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal of ALT occurred in 5.3% of patients taking Fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo [FDA Label]. If enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit, therapy is to be discontinued [FDA Label]. After discontinuing fenofibrate treatment or during continued treatment a return to normal transaminase limits was usually observed [FDA Label]. The incidence of increases in transaminases observed with fenofibrate therapy appear to be dose related [FDA Label]. From an 8 week dose-ranging study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations to at least three times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 35 mg to 105 mg fenofibric acid per day and was comparatively 0% in those receiving placebo or doses equivalent to 35 mg or less fenofibric acid per day [FDA Label]. Hepatocellular, chronic active and cholestatic hepatitis associated with Fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years [FDA Label]. In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in associated with chronic active hepatitis [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreases in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on Fenofibrate [FDA Label]. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of the drug [FDA Label]. Although the clinical significance of these observations is unknown, renal monitoring should be considered for patients with renal impairment and for patients at risk for renal insufficiency, perhaps like patients with diabetes or the elderly [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nFenofibric acid may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis [FDA Label]. If gallstones are found, fenofibric acid should be discontinued [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution must be exercised over the ability of fenofibric acid to potentiate the anticoagulant effects of coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in prolongation of the prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR) [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nPancreatitis has also been reported in patients taking Fenofibrate [FDA Label]. This effect may be caused by the failure of efficacy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a direct drug effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge formation with obstruction of the common bile duct [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nMild to moderate hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in patients following the start of fenofibrate therapy [FDA Label]. However, although these levels tend to stabilize during long-term administration of the medication [FDA Label], thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis have been observed in patients treated with fenofibrates as well [FDA Label]. Scheduled monitoring of red and white blood cell counts during the first 12 months of fenofibric acid administration is subsequently recommended [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nAcute hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis requiring patient hospitalization and treatment with steroids have been reported in patients treated with fenofibrates [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fenofibrate arm during the FIELD trial, occurrences of pulmonary embolus (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were recorded at higher rates when compared to the placebo group [FDA Label]. In particular, the placebo group had N=4900 and the fenofibrate group N=4895 [FDA Label]. For DVT there were 48 events (1%) in the placebo group and 67 (1%) in the fenofibrate group with p=0.074 [FDA Label]. While for PE, there were 32 (0.7%) events in the placebo group and 53 (1%) in the fenofibrate group with p=0.022 [FDA Label]. Likewise, in the Coronary Drug Project, a higher proportion of the clofibrate group reported definite or suspected fatal or nonfatal PE or thrombophlebitis when compared to the placebo group (5.2% vs 3.3% at 5 years with p<0.01) [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally there have been postmarketing and clinical trial reports of serious paradoxical decreases in HDL cholesterol levels to as low as 2 mg/dL happening in diabetic and non-diabetic patients initiated on fibrate therapy [FDA Label]. This decrease in HDL-C is accompanied by a decrease in apolipoprotein A1. Such decreases have been reported to occur within 2 weeks to years after initiation of fibrate therapy [FDA Label]. The HDL-C levels remain depressed until fibrate therapy has been withdrawn; the response to withdrawal of fibrate therapy is in fact rapid and sustained [FDA Label]. HDL-C levels are recommended to be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy. In the case of severely depressed HDL-C levels being detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn and HDL-C levels monitored until it has returned to baseline with no intention or plan to re-initiate fibrate therapy [FDA Label].\\r\\n\\r\\nAdverse effects associated with the use of fenofibrate and fenofibric acid include abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, constipation, abnormal liver tests, increased AST, increased ALT, increased creatine phosphokinase, respiratory disorder, rhinitis, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, and/or dizziness [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nAdverse effects identified during the post-approval use period of fenofibrate include rhabdomyolysis, panrcreatitis, renal failure, muscle spasms, acute renal failure, hepatitis, cirrhosis, anemia, asthenia, and severely depressed HDL-cholesterol levels [L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Fenofibric acid has the capability to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin anticoagulants (and subsequently prolong the PT/INR of patients), caution should be exercised when oral coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with fenofibric acid. Frequent PT/INR determinations are therefore advisable until stabilized PT/INR readings are obtained\\r\\n[FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nFenofibric acid should be administered to patients at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid resin is given as such drugs may bind other agents being given concurrently and impede their absorption [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nImmunosuppressant medications like cyclosporine and tacrolimus can cause nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the main elimination route for fenofibric acid, there exists a risk that an interaction could lead to deterioration of renal function [FDA Label, L1526]. As a consequence, the benefits and risks of using fenofibric acid with any other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered and the lowest effective dose employed [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nCases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when considering the combination use of fenofibrates with colchicine [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nNo well controlled studies regarding the use of fenofibric acid in pregnant women have been established [FDA Label, L1526]. Since the safety of fenofibric acid in pregnant women has not been formally elucidated, fenofibric acid should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, fenofibric acid should not be used in nursing mothers. Under the circumstances, a decision should be made between having to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the use of fenofibric acid, taking into perspective the importance of the drug therapy to the mother [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety and effectiveness of fenofibric acid in paediatric patients has not been formally established [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nFenofibric acid is predominantly excreted by the kidney system unchanged or as fenofibric acid glucuronide [FDA Label, L1526]. The risk of experiencing adverse reactions associated with exposure to fenofibric acid may consequently be greater in patients with impaired renal function [FDA Label, L1526]. Subsequently, because elderly patients may have a higher incidence of renal impairment, the dosage of fenofibric acid for geriatric patients should be based upon renal function, with normal renal function requiring no dosage modifications [FDA Label, L1526]. Renal function monitoring in elderly patients taking fenofibric acid is recommended [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn patients with severe renal impairment, the use of fenofibric acid is to be avoided while dose reductions is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [FDA Label, L1526]. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of fenofibric acid has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 24 month study, Wistar rats were dosed at various levels of fenofibrate. At a dose of 200mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] based on body surface area comparisons mg/m2), the incidence of liver carcinomas was significantly increased in both sexes of the rats [FDA Label, L1526]. At doses of 10 (0.3 times the MRHD) and 200 mg/kg/day, a statistically significant increase in pancreatic carcinomas was observed in males, and an increase in pancreatic adenomas and benign testicular interstitial cell tumours were observed at 200 mg/kg/day in males [FDA Label, L1526]. In a second 24 month study on the Sprague-Dawley strain of rats, doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg/day produced significant increases in the incidence of pancreatic acinar adenomas in both sexes of the rats and increases in interstitial cell tumours of the testes at 2 times the MRHD [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, fenofibrate 10 and 60 mg/kg/day, clofibrate 400 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD), and gemfibrozil 250 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD) are studied in a 117 week study in rats. Fenofibrate increased pancreatic acing adenomas in both sexes of the rats [FDA Label, L1526]. Clofibrate increased hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic acinar adenomas in males and hepatic neoplastic nodules in females [FDA Label, L1526]. And finally, gemfibrozil increased hepatic neoplastic nodules in males and females, while all three drugs increased testicular interstitial cell tumours in males [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 21 month study with CF-1 mice, fenofibrate 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2, 1, and 3 times the MRHD) significantly increased the liver carcinomas in both sexes at 3 times the MRHD [FDA Label, L1526]. With a second 18 month study at 10, 60, and 200 mg/kg/day, fenofibrate significantly increased the liver carcinomas in male and female mice 3 times the MRHD [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in peroxisome morphology and numbers have been observed in humans after treatment with other members of the fibrate class when liver biopsies were compared before and after treatment in the same individual [FDA Label, L1526]\\r\\n\\r\\nFenofibrate was shown to be devoid of mutagenic potential in the Ames and micronucleus tests in vivo/rat [FDA Label, L1526]. In addition, fenofibric acid, has bee.n demonstrated to be devoid of mutagenic potential in the following tests: Ames, mouse lymphoma, chromosomal aberration and sister chromatid exchange in human lymphocytes, and unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes [FDA Label, L1526].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a fertility study, rats were given oral dietary doses of fenofibrate. Males received doses for 61 days prior to mating and females for 15 days prior to mating through weaning, which resulted in no adverse effect on fertility at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (~10 times the MRHD, based on mg/m2 surface area comparisons) [FDA Label, L1526].',\n",

For mothers with nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, there are limited data on the presence of dronabinol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The reported effects of inhaled cannabis transferred to the breastfeeding infant have been inconsistent and insufficient to establish causality.

Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychoactive effects of SYNDROS. SYNDROS contains the excipients 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol and 5.5% (w/w) propylene glycol. Ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations of propylene glycol.

Elderly patients with dementia are at increased risk for falls as a result of their underlying disease state, which may be exacerbated by the CNS effects of somnolence and dizziness associated with\\r\\nSYNDROS. These patients should be monitored closely and placed on fall precautions prior to initiating SYNDROS therapy. In antiemetic studies, no difference in efficacy was apparent in patients greater than 55 years of age compared to younger\\r\\npatients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of falls decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, increased sensitivity to psychoactive effects, and concomitant disease or other drugs therapy.[L43438]\\r\\n\\r\\nSYNDROS contains dronabinol, the main psychoactive component in marijuana. Ingestion of high doses of dronabinol increases the risk of psychiatric adverse reactions if abused or misused, while continued administration can lead to addiction. Psychiatric adverse reactions may include psychosis, hallucinations, depersonalization, mood alteration, and paranoia. In vitro studies demonstrate that SYNDROS can be easily and effectively abused without manipulation. SYNDROS contains 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol. In a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled crossover pharmacodynamic study of 43 experienced marijuana smokers, “drug liking” responses and safety of SYNDROS were compared with placebo and dronabinol in sesame oil oral capsules.

Overall, the pharmacodynamic results from this study demonstrated no statistically significant differences in various measures of drug liking for the doses taken, though the SYNDROS results were consistently greater than those of dronabinol capsules. Similarly, observed adverse reactions were greater for SYNDROS. The pharmacodynamic and safety effects of SYNDROS following multiple doses have not been evaluated. Patients should be instructed to keep SYNDROS in a secure place out of reach of others for whom the medication has not been prescribed.[L43438] \\r\\n\\r\\nPhysical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use. Physical dependence manifests by drug class-specific withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

       "       'Has been shown to cause chromosomal aneuploidy and male infertility. Should be avoided during all stages of pregnancy, lactation and puberty.  Is a potential risk factor for cancer. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, The European Medical Association (EMA) mandated that the use of thiocolchicoside-containing medicines by mouth or injection should be restricted across the European Union (EU). These drugs are now recommended only as an add-on treatment for painful muscle contractures resulting from spinal conditions in adults and adolescents 16 years old and older.  Additionally, the dose of thiocolchicoside by mouth or injection should be limited.  This is due to experimental evidence suggesting that thiocolchicoside was metabolized into M2 or SL59.0955,  that has the propensity to damage dividing cells, resulting in aneuploidy (an abnormal number or arrangement of chromosomes). As a result, the CHMP (committee for medicinal products for human use) examined the safety profile of this medicine and consider what regulatory action might be appropriate [L1656].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CHMP reviewed the evidence, with consideration of opinions from experts in medicines safety, and concluded that aneuploidy may occur with M2 at levels not significantly greater than those measured after recommended doses of thiocolchicoside ingested orally. Aneuploidy is a strong risk factor for fetal harm, decreased fertility in men, and could theoretically increase the risk of developing cancer [L1656].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maximum recommended oral dose is 8 mg every 12 hours; treatment length should not exceed 7 consecutive days. When given intramuscularly (IM), the maximum dose is 4 mg every 12 hours, for a maximum of 5 days [L1656].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the above toxicity, a study was done on the hepatotoxic potential of thiocolchicoside.  It was observed that serum AST and ALT levels increased following of the administration oral thiocolchicoside at 8 mg/day. Two weeks after discontinuing thiocolchicoside therapy, liver enzymes had decreased to levels within the normal range. Although infrequent, thiocolchicoside should be considered a rare hepatotoxic agent in clinical practice [A32121].',\n",

Based on the mechanism of action of lenvatinib and results from animal reproduction studies, which showed embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity and teratogenicity at lenvatinib doses below the recommended dose in humans, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 2 weeks following completion of therapy.
